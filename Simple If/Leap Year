# Simple if
# Question:
# Check if a given year is a leap year. Print "Leap year" if it is, otherwise print "Not a leap year".
# (A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless it is divisible by 400.)

# Answer:
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print("Leap year")
else:
    print("Not a leap year")
