# Challenge
# Question:
# Implement a program that reads a text file and creates a new file with reversed lines.
# Print the first few lines of the reversed file.

# Answer:
def reverse_lines(input_file_path, output_file_path):
    with open(input_file_path, 'r') as input_file:
        lines = input_file.readlines()

    reversed_lines = [line.strip()[::-1] + '\n' for line in lines]

    with open(output_file_path, 'w') as output_file:
        output_file.writelines(reversed_lines)

file_path = input("Enter the path of the input text file: ")
output_path = input("Enter the path for the output reversed file: ")
reverse_lines(file_path, output_path)

with open(output_path, 'r') as reversed_file:
    print("First few lines of the reversed file:")
    for _ in range(5):
        print(reversed_file.readline().strip())
