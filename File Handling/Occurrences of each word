# Challenge
# Question:
# Implement a program that reads a text file and counts the occurrences of each word.
# Print the word frequencies.

# Answer:
def count_word_occurrences(file_path):
    word_counts = {}
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            words = line.strip().split()
            for word in words:
                word = word.lower()
                word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1
    return word_counts

file_path = input("Enter the path of the text file: ")
word_occurrences = count_word_occurrences(file_path)
print("Word frequencies:")
for word, count in word_occurrences.items():
    print(f"{word}: {count}")
