# Challenge
# Question:
# Write a program that reads a text file and creates a new file with only the unique lines.
# Print the first few unique lines from the new file.

# Answer:
def filter_unique_lines(input_file_path, output_file_path):
    unique_lines = set()
    with open(input_file_path, 'r') as input_file:
        for line in input_file:
            unique_lines.add(line)

    with open(output_file_path, 'w') as output_file:
        output_file.writelines(unique_lines)

file_path = input("Enter the path of the input text file: ")
output_path = input("Enter the path for the output file with unique lines: ")
filter_unique_lines(file_path, output_path)

with open(output_path, 'r') as unique_file:
    print("First few unique lines from the new file:")
    for _ in range(5):
        print(unique_file.readline().strip())
