# Challenge
# Question:
# Write a program that reads a CSV file containing student information (name, age, grade).
# Calculate the average grade and print the student with the highest grade.

# Answer:
import csv

def analyze_student_data(file_path):
    total_grades = 0
    max_grade = 0
    top_student = None

    with open(file_path, 'r') as csv_file:
        csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
        header = next(csv_reader)  # Skip the header row
        for row in csv_reader:
            name, age, grade = row
            grade = float(grade)
            total_grades += grade
            if grade > max_grade:
                max_grade = grade
                top_student = name

    average_grade = total_grades / (csv_reader.line_num - 1)
    return average_grade, top_student, max_grade

file_path = input("Enter the path of the CSV file: ")
average, top_student, max_grade = analyze_student_data(file_path)
print(f"Average Grade: {average}")
print(f"Top Student: {top_student} (Grade: {max_grade})")
