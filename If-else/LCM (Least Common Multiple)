# Challenge
# Question:
# Implement a program to find the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers.
# Print the result.

# Answer:
def find_lcm(x, y):
    greater = max(x, y)
    while True:
        if greater % x == 0 and greater % y == 0:
            lcm = greater
            break
        greater += 1
    return lcm

num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
lcm_result = find_lcm(num1, num2)
print(f"The LCM of {num1} and {num2} is: {lcm_result}")
