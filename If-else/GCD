# Challenge
# Question:
# Implement a program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
# Print the result.

# Answer:
def find_gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
gcd_result = find_gcd(num1, num2)
print(f"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is {gcd_result}")
